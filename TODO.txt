textbox issues
    - long line with chinese and english randomly sprinked causes cursor to go off screen when pushing right sometimes depending on length.
    - When new chinese character scrolls off english, the cursor position blanks out until a full character can be displayed.
    - rename textbox to textBox

textbox test cases:
    - check if clicking dead Y zone jumps forward to end of Y string that is off textbox view. (Longer than view)
    - Check if clicking dead y zone jumps back to end of y string that is off text view. (Shorter than another longer string)
